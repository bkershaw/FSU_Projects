April 18th:
      Coppied all files over neccessary for project 

April 19th: 
      built moviematch.h with definition and implmentations, left all
      implmentations blank unless returning values if so gave them dummy values
      just so that I was able to compile and build kb.x even though there is no
      logic and it is unable to run it provides me with a nice clean start all
      ready for implmentations.  Started adding implmentatins of Load() it is
      very similar to wordsmith reading in the movies and actors incrementing
      the counters and first checking to see if it exsits before inserting into
      vector.  making sure to call line() on every incoming movie and actor.
      Than Hash data and call Rehash to setup the hash table.  Finally add the
      verticies and edges for the graph with a call to addEdge()

      Init()

April 21st :


April 22nd:
      unable to complete any testing due to issue with proccessing g_lower_bound
      I have passed it 4 arguments as required and still screaming error due to
      mismatch type 'const'.  Changed operator() to const fixing the error.
      Still not sure why this was a problem but satisified compiler.

April 23rd:
      Unable to complete final test on autobot due to shell server being down. *update:
      Was able to submit through quake server and have many output diff's due to
      cout statments, and a massive dump of data_[] printing out every vector
      index.  Issue was found in a call to hint_.dump() printing the entire
      vector in every instance of kb.x this was from a test I was doing to check
      the iterator for begin and end
